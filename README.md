# CloudSurf: Browser Agent

Welcome to CloudSurf! This guide will help you get started with using our [browser agent extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gcelmghkopoeedfdnkegljogpbdcfplm?utm_source=item-share-cb).

## What is CloudSurf?

CloudSurf is a browser assistant that can help you perform tasks on the web. It's particularly useful for tasks that would take you 1-5 minutes to do manually or tasks which are repetitive in nature. The extension controls your browser on your behalf, performing actions as if you were doing them yourself.

## Key Features

- **Browser Automation**: Performs web actions like clicking, typing, and navigating
- **Contextual Research**: Perform research starting from a web page, e.g. analyzing all posts linked to from a blog home page, or all products on a Amazon search result page.
- **Research Capabilities**: Can gather and synthesize information from multiple sources
- **Subtask Support**: Can break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple**: Start with a simple task to familiarize yourself with the agents limitations and then gradually try more complex tasks as you become comfortable
2. **Keep Tasks Focused**: Tasks that take 1-5 minutes manually work best.
3. **Be Specific**: Provide clear instructions on how to do something if you want to minimize ambiguity (i.e. if you don't want to depend on agents decision making)
4. **Verify Results**: Always check the results for important tasks

## Browser Control & User Responsibility

- **Browser Control**: The extension will control your browser tabs to complete tasks. It will click, type, and navigate just as you would.
- **Trust & Safety**: Only give tasks to the agent that you feel comfortable having it perform on your behalf. The agent will have access to the same permissions as you do in the browser.
- **Multi-tab Usage**: You can freely use other tabs in your browser while the agent is working. However, please avoid interacting with the tabs that the agent is actively working on, as this will interfere with its ability to complete the task.

## Limitations

CloudSurf is at an early stage and as such has many limitations at the moment, e.g.:

- Does not work on sites using HTML canvas (e.g., Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Maps)
- Limited to "pure web" actions (such as clicking, typing). Cannot download/upload files, add bookmarks, etc.
- Cannot edit existing text (can only write new text)
- Reliability decreases with longer tasks

## Pricing

- Everyone gets 20 free "tasks" (a task is either a user request or a subtask)
- After the free tier, pricing is $20 per 100 tasks
